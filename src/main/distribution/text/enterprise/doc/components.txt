Neo4j Components
==================

The included jars in the `lib` directory provide an easy-to-get-going 
distribution of essential components for "embedded programming" a
graph database on the Java Virtual Machine.

Included in this release of Neo4j are:

   neo4j-kernel          the neo4j graph database engine
   neo4j-index           indexing and data structures
   neo4j-remote-graphdb  thin layer to enable remote access to a neo4j instance
   neo4j-shell           command shell for browsing and manipulating the graph
   neo4j-online-backup   create backups of a running neo4j graph database
   neo4j-graph-algo      graph algorithms (such as shortest path algorithm)
   neo4j-udc             usage data collector
   neo4j-lucene-index    integrated index implementation

The `lib` directory contains the binary jar files for all components as well as 
required third-party libraries. 

The included usage data collector component will send basic information like     
for example version number to udc.neo4j.org once a day and can easily be disabled,
